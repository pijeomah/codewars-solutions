// There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:

// number of pillars (≥ 1);
// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);
// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).
// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar).

//My Solution
function pillars(numPill, dist, width) {
    if(numPill < 2){
     return 0
    }else{
       const wap = (numPill - 2) * width 
      const dap = (numPill - 1) * 100 * dist 
    return dap + wap
    }
  }
