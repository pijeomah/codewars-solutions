// The sperm cell determines the sex of an individual in this case. If a sperm cell containing an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote will be XX or female. If the sperm cell contains a Y chromosome, then the resulting zygote will be XY or male.

// Determine if the sex of the offspring will be male or female based on the X or Y chromosome present in the male's sperm.

// If the sperm contains the X chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a daughter."; If the sperm contains the Y chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a son.";

//My solution
const chromosomeCheck = (sperm) => sperm === 'XX' ? "Congratulations! You're going to have a daughter." :"Congratulations! You're going to have a son."
